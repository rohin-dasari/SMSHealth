This was done with Python 3.7.0
The packages required required are and flask and twilio. If you're running Conda, you want to make a virtual environment first and make sure that its in Python 3.7

Make sure you have a twilio account and have your key and number set up in the python file

Once you have that set up, just pip install Flask and Twilio and run the python file from your terminal. 


Copy the link that Flask provides and add a "/send" at the end of the link
